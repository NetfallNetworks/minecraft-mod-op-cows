# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Moo of Doom — a NeoForge 1.21.11 Minecraft mod that makes cows absurdly overpowered.

## Build & Test

- **Build**: `./gradlew build --no-configuration-cache`
- **Tests only**: `./gradlew test --no-configuration-cache`
- **Java**: 21 (required)
- **Gradle**: 9.2.1 (via wrapper)

### Claude Code Web (Sandbox) Builds

The sandbox proxy requires authentication that Java's `HttpClient` can't
provide automatically, causing NeoForm artifact downloads to fail with
HTTP 407. Use the proxy relay wrapper instead:

```bash
scripts/sandbox-build.sh                  # full build
scripts/sandbox-build.sh test             # tests only
scripts/sandbox-build.sh build --info     # any Gradle args
```

This starts a local proxy relay (`scripts/proxy_relay.py`) that injects
the `Proxy-Authorization` header, then runs Gradle through it.

**Known limitation:** the sandbox egress allowlist may not include all
Mojang CDN domains (e.g. `piston-meta.mojang.com`), so builds may still
fail with HTTP 403 on artifact downloads. Track upstream progress at
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11897. If this happens,
rely on CI to validate the build after pushing.

## Pre-Push Checklist

**IMPORTANT: Always run the full build locally before every push.**

```bash
./gradlew build --no-configuration-cache
```

Do NOT push if the build fails. Fix all compilation errors and test failures first.
If the build cannot run locally (e.g. network restrictions), note this explicitly
when pushing and monitor the CI build immediately after.

## CI Workflows

- **build.yml**: Runs on every push and PRs to main. Builds, tests, uploads JAR artifact.
- **release.yml**: Triggered via GitHub Actions UI (workflow_dispatch) or tag push. Builds, creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes and JAR.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/github/netfallnetworks/mooofdoom/` — mod source code
- `src/test/java/` — unit tests (JUnit 5)
- `src/main/templates/META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` — mod metadata template
- `gradle.properties` — version numbers, mod metadata
- `scripts/` — build utilities (proxy relay for sandbox environments)

## Conventions

- Mod ID: `mooofdoom`
- Version: derived from git tags (`v*.*.*`), falls back to `gradle.properties`
- Tests must be deterministic — always seed `Random` instances

## Plan Documents

Plan documents live in `docs/plans/` and follow the format described in
`docs/plans/CONVENTIONS.md`. Read that file before writing or modifying plans.
